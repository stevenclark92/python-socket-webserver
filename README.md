# Python web server
A simple webserver with Python that accepts incoming requests on port 8888 and responds with a 200 HTTP code and a few lines of HTML in-browser.

## To use
Run the script and navigate to localhost:8888 and a few lines of HTML are rendered in-browser. Need to add functionality to print request information to console.
